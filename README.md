# felix
Latin for 'lucky'.  

If work + luck = PROFIT, then work + felix = PROFIT. 

The idea for this project was based on how quant firms need to access real time data on interesting events in the market that could influence stock performance and affect investments.

Felix, therefore, is a tool that works to source real-time market news from selected news sources(NewsAPI, New York Times, Reddit, Twitter) and updates a news feed with these articles and posts with a sentiment analysis score, given by an LLM, on the article. The user can also search for particular stocks on the platform, see relevant financial data and some relevant artciles or posts with sentiment scores attached and a summary of overall stock performance in market. 

Why Felix?
“I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it” -- Thomas Jefferson

Felix will do the work of gathering relevant and insightful market data for you while increasing your luck quotient, thus making you a better investor and lining your pockets with more bread.

Feeling lucky? Try Felix.
